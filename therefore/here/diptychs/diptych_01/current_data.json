What becomes relevant is the connection between the two, the joint, being this connection conceptual or formal.</p><p>A contradiction:</p><p>The two recordings on each diptych are of the same thing, recorded at the same time.</p><p>The two recordings on each diptych are of the same thing, recorded at different times.<br>The video on the left was recorded first.
