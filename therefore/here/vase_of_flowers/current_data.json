This work is about the concept of representation. The representation of an idea (Hell - Heaven), of our desire (Artefacts), of our surroundings (Nature). In some of the prints the images overlap. In others, I have repainted with different levels of fidelity what is represented in the original painting. A realistic representation, abstract strokes or flat surfaces. </p><p>A flow of images representing themselves.</p><div class=\"words\"><span>Nature</span><span>Artefacts</span><span>Hell</span><span>Heaven</span></div>"
