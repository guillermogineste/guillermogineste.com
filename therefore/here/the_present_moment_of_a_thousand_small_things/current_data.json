    "description": "<p>The present moment of a thousand small things</p><p>Each part of this video has two layers. The background layer is an abstraction of different recordings of flowing water. A one pixel horizontal line is extracted from the original video and repeated several times, this group of lines is stretched to fill the height of the frame. A composition of various overlapping loops forms the second layer. The loops come from classic animated films from the 30s and 40s, the beginning of the golden age of american animation.</p><p>The superposition of layers creates an opposition of a meditative image, the abstracted water flowing, and the fast and silly feeling of the animated graphic elements.</p><p>On each of the three parts the stretched pixel lines are offset in time a few frames, this delay creates a soft cascading movement. In the first part, the offset gives the illusion of ascension. In part II the offset is vertically symmetric, giving no specific movement illusion. In the last part the offset gives the impression of descending movement.</p><p>Under the video, all its parts are displayed â€” Frames from the original water videos and every animated loop with the number of frames it lasts.</p>"
