The golden ratio is used to create not only a structure for visual composition, both in the video and in the series of images, but also as a time pattern in the video.</p><p>Each series of images is a sequence representing a daily habit, a small ritual like cooking or dressing. The 24 images refer to the standard film measure of frames per second, the movement of the actions is invalidated by making each frame a separated image, a static representation of movement.</p>"
